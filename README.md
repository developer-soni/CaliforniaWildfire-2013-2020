# CaliforniaWildfire-2013-2020

In this project, we analyzed data sets for California Wildfires ranging from 2013 to 2020 and implemented sorting functions to get a better understanding on the main areas of damage, number of deaths, fatalaties, structures damaged or destroyed, etc. Through this output we were able to design special solutions to prevent wildfires in certain areas and create awareness for precautions and actions to take in the society.
